# Matt Woods Details Form Wordpress Plugin

Version 1.0

This is Wordpress plugin which allows the user to update certain details and update some optional fields

# Compiling Sass

* cd directory
* $ npm install
* $ composer install
* $ gulp

** Plugin Information **

* I've added Foundation to the plugin but might be overkill for this project
* The plugin uses Sass and Gulp to compile
* I've uploaded the generated CSS file, but this would be overwritten when running Gulp
* Ive included Fontawesome within the fonts
* A minimum amount of CSS was used as I'd expect the plugin would be styled externally to the plugin and take styling from the theme set.

** Future changes if had more dev time **

* Update submit button to match design
* Add in some tests where I can
* Check if any code can be refactored, minimised etc
* Update the plugin settings file with ability to set certain options
